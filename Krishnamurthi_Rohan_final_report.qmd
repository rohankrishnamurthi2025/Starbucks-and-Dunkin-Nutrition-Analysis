## Introduction

In this report, I am inquiring about the nutritional information of Starbucks' and Dunkin Donuts' food and drink items. The first dataset I am analyzing contains relevant nutritional information of all beverages available at Starbucks. The second dataset concerns all of the food items available at Starbucks. The third dataset concerns the nutritional information of all  products, both food and drink items, available at Dunkin Donuts.

### Motivation for Research

I chose these datasets because I normally enjoy both Starbucks's and Dunkin Donuts' offerings. However, it must be noted that many students and I are currently boycotting Starbucks due to the company's decision to not support for the Palestinian people given the humanitarian crisis they are currently experiencing. While I enjoy their products, I currently will not support the company due to this issue.

Nevertheless, I have had plenty of items from both their drink and food menus and I feel knowledgeable enough to work with data concerning both. Also, I really enjoy making and trying intricate coffee and tea drinks, so I'd be happy to work with data regarding Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. I decided to include the food information as well as a challenge to work with multiple sets of data. Working with data from both Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts allows more depth in the exploration of nutrition information.

### Research Questions

The overarching research question for this EDA is what can one consume at either Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts in order to maintain a healthy, nutritious diet. There are many ways to address this question. Some initial querries are how do the calories, fat, protein and sugar vary by drink type or by food item at either retailer. To involve both food and drink items, I propose investigating which combination of food and drink items is most nutritious, at either Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts. A related question I have is which drink or food items are least nutritious and should be generally avoided. Lastly, I propose questioning how nutritious food and drinks vary from Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts, and which restaurant has the most nutritious options overall.

## Data Overview and Quality

The three raw datasets were then copied into new datasets, which were then cleaned and prepared for analysis. The first raw dataset, entitled "starbucks.csv", contains 18 variables and 242 observations, corresponding to 242 different drinks. Three of the variables contain categorical data, corresponding to drink identifiers, and the remaining 15 variables contain numerical data, corresponding to nutritional information. There are some observations (specifically, caffeine) with missing nutritional values, which contain NA instead of the actual numerical values.

The second raw dataset, stored as "starbucks_menu_nutrition_food_redo.csv", contains 6 variables and 113 observations, corresponding to 113 different food items. One variable contains categorical data, corresponding to the food name. The remaining five variables contain numerical data, corresponding to the nutritional information, such as calories, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, and protein content. There are no missing values in this data set.

The third raw dataset, stored as "dunkindonutsnutrition.csv", contains 13 variables and 790 observations, corresponding to 780 different products sold by Dunking Donuts. All variables are stored as character vectors. Two variables concern the item category and name, while the remaining variables concern nutritional information. There are no missing values in this data set either.

### Starbucks Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the `0a_starbucks_data_preparation` R script, the dataset "starbucks_menu_nutrition_food_redo.csv" was read in, copied as `starbucks_food_data`, and then cleaned. The first issue with the raw data was that the variable names had spaces, which could make it difficult ot select these variables. The spaces were replaced with underscores using the names() function. Also, the variable names were be made into lowercase names for consistency.

The dataset "starbucks.csv" was read in, copied as `starbucks_drinks_data`, and then cleaned as well. The data frame had the same issue in that the column names had uppercase letters and spaces. This was addressed using the names() function as well. Additionally, in the column names "Total Fat g", "Dietary Fiber g", and "Total Carbohydrates g", the initial word was be removed so these variables would have identical names to the `starbucks_food_data` dataset. This made facilitated joining observations in both data frames.

In the `beverage_prep` column of `starbucks_drink_data`, the size of beverage was missing in some observations but could be deduced from the size listed of the previous (or second previous) beverage. The size was added to this column using a "for loop" to iterate through each observation and if statements to identify the size and then add it to the observation.

Additionally, the information in the `beverage_prep` column in `starbucks_drinks_data` was used to create new variables-- one for milk type and one for size. First, the column `milk_type` was developed bt extracting the type of milk from the `beverage_prep` column. Drinks without any milk intentionally had `NA` in this column. A for loop was used to iterate through each observation in the `beverage_prep` column, and if statements were used to identify the type of milk and add it to the `milk_type` column for each observation. The column `size` was added by extracting the size of drink from the `beverage_prep` column. A for loop can was to iterate through each observation in the `beverage_prep` column, and if statements were used to identify the beverage size and add it to the `size` column for each observation.

Finally, a new data frame entitled `starbucks_all_data` was created by joining the two existing data frames with the merge() function. The `beverage` and `food_item` variables were renamed to `item`, so the data frames could share this variable. Then, the two data frames were combined by the variables `item`, `calories`, `fat_g`, `carb_g`, `fiber_g`, and `protein_g`, having selected these variables upon entering the data sets into the merge() function.

### Dunkin Donuts Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the `0b_dunkin_data_preparation` R script, the dataset "dunkindonutsnutrition.csv" was read in, copied as `dunkin_donuts_data`, and then cleaned. First, the variable named were changed with the names function to remove parentheses and spaces. Additionally, the names were made lowercase for consistency. 

A new variable, `item_type` was created as a factor. The factor "drink" was assigned to drinks (based on the `category` variable) and the factor "food" was assigned to food items. Variables corresponding to nutritional information were converted into numeric vectors, as they generally contained numeric values. Moreover, a new factor variable, `size`, was created to identify the size of each product. The size was extracted from the `item` name using the grepl() function. Items that were not given a size or milk_type were assigned a factor of "not applicable". Similarly, a new factor variable, `milk_type`, was created to identify the type of milk in each product, if applicable. 

Finally, the data was filtered into two new datasets: `dunkin_donuts_drinks_data`, containing the drink observations; and `dunkin_donuts_food_data`, containing the food observations.

From the R scripts, the cleaned datasets were downloaded as csv files using the write_csv() function, and then they were accessed using the read_csv() function.

## Explorations

### Analysis of Drinks



#### Nutritional Content by Drink Category

##### Sugar, Fat, and Calories Content
The first question I sought to answer was which drinks are considered the healthiest. I initially approached this quesiton by comparing the fat, sugar, and calorie content of drinks. In these categories, a beverage with a lower amount of each of these nutrients is considered healthier. For this analysis, I compared drink categories, rather than the individual drinks themselves, as it made it easier to make generalizations about drinks. 

The following table and three figures depict the fat, sugar, and calorie content of types of drinks sold by Starbucks.
```{r}
starbucks_table <- starbucks_drinks_data |> 
  group_by(beverage_category) |> 
  summarize(fat = round(mean(fat_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            sugar = round(mean(sugars_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            calories = round(mean(calories, na.rm = TRUE))) |> 
  rename("Average sugar content (g)" = sugar, 
         "Average fat content (g)" = fat,
         "Average calories" = calories,
         "Drink Category" = beverage_category)

kable(starbucks_table, caption = "Starbucks Drinks Nutritional Info")

```

```{r}
dunkin_table <- dunkin_donuts_drinks_data |> 
  group_by(category) |> 
  summarize(fat = round(mean(fat_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            sugar = round(mean(sugars_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            calories = round(mean(calories, na.rm = TRUE))) |> 
  rename("Average sugar content (g)" = sugar, 
         "Average fat content (g)" = fat,
         "Average calories" = calories,
         "Drink Category" = category)

##### Protein, Calcium, and Vitamin A and C Content
I then address this questioned by investigating which beverages at each retailer had the highest amount of protein, calcium, and vitamins. In these categories, a beverage with a high content of each of these nutrients is considered more healthy.

The Starbucks drinks data contains information regarding each drink's protein, calcium, and vitamin A and C content. The content of each of these nutrients is compared in the following table and graphs. A boxplot was used to compare protein content, similar to the other nutrients. However, frequency polygons were used to compare calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin C content due to a lack of data points other than 0%.

```{r}
starbucks_table_2 <- starbucks_drinks_data |> 
  group_by(beverage_category) |> 
  summarize(protein = round(mean(protein_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            calcium = round(mean(calcium_percent_dv, na.rm = TRUE)),
            vitamin_a = round(mean(vitamin_a_percent_dv, na.rm = TRUE)),
            vitamin_c = round(mean(vitamin_c_percent_dv, na.rm = TRUE))) |> 
  rename("Average protein content (g)" = protein, 
         "Average calcium (%DV)" = calcium,
         "Average vitamin A (%DV)" = vitamin_a,
         "Average vitamin C (%DV)" = vitamin_c,
         "Drink Category" = beverage_category)
kable(starbucks_table_2, caption = "Starbucks Drinks Nutritional Info, continued")

```

ANALYZE.

The Dunkin Donuts drinks data only contains information regarding each drink's protein content. The protein content of each type of drink sold at Dunkin is compared in the following table and boxplot.

```{r}
dunkin_table_2 <- dunkin_donuts_drinks_data |> 
  group_by(category) |> 
  summarize(protein = round(mean(protein_g, na.rm = TRUE))) |> 
  rename("Average protein content (g)" = protein,
         "Drink Category" = category)
kable(dunkin_table_2, caption = "Dunkin Donuts Drinks Nutritional Info, continued")
```

ANALYZE.

#### Nutritional Content by Milk Type

Another question I sought to answer is how the nutrition content of each drink varies by milk type. When people order drinks from coffee shops, there are many different ways they can customize their drink to their liking. Thus, I found it important to analyze nutrition by milk preference. For this analysis, I measured the fat, sugar, calories, and then protein of drinks having grouped them by milk type. I created boxplots to depict how these nutrients vary by each type of milk.

The following table and boxplots depict the average fat, sugar, calories, and protein for drinks of each type of milk at Starbucks. Observations with no milk were excluded from this analysis.

```{r}

starbucks_milk_table <- starbucks_drinks_data |> 
  group_by(milk_type) |> 
  summarize(fat = round(mean(fat_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            sugar = round(mean(sugars_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            calories = round(mean(calories, na.rm = TRUE)),
            protein = round(mean(protein_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            ) |> 
  rename("Protein content (g)" = protein, 
         "Sugar content (g)" = sugar,
         "Calories" = calories,
         "Fat (g)" = fat,
         "Milk Type" = milk_type)
kable(starbucks_milk_table, caption = "Starbucks Drinks Average Nutritional Info by Type of Milk")


```

ANALYZE.

The following table and boxplots reports the average fat, sugar, calories, and protein for drinks of each type of milk at Dunkin Donuts. Observations with no milk were excluded from this analysis.

```{r}
dunkin_milk_table <- dunkin_donuts_drinks_data |> 
  filter(milk_type != "not applicable") |> 
  group_by(milk_type) |> 
  summarize(fat = round(mean(fat_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            sugar = round(mean(sugars_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            calories = round(mean(calories, na.rm = TRUE)),
            protein = round(mean(protein_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            ) |> 
  rename("Protein content (g)" = protein, 
         "Sugar content (g)" = sugar,
         "Calories" = calories,
         "Fat (g)" = fat,
         "Milk Type" = milk_type)

Due to large overlap of boxes in the boxplots, as well as an abundance of outliers, I added density plots to better distinguish the nutritional information of each type of milk.

#### New metrics to assess healthiness of drinks

In the previous section, I analyzed which typs of beverage had high (or low) contents of specific nutrients. There are more nuanced ways to assess the "healthiness" of a drink. In this section, I am to incorporate multiple variables to develop new ways to analyze healthiness.

##### Beverages rich in protein

First, I sought to determine which types of beverages were richest in protein while lowest unhealthy quantities, such as calories and fat. I compared the ratio of protein to calories for each drink type. Nevertheless, protein content can also be compared to sugar, fat, or other quantities for different metrics.

In the following table and scatterplot, I compare the ratio of grams of protein to calories for types of drinks at Starbucks. Due to difficulty in distinguishing data points in the scatterplot, I added faceted scatterplots as well.

```{r}
starbucks_protein_table <- starbucks_drinks_data |> 
  group_by(beverage_category) |> 
  summarize(protein = round(mean(protein_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            calories = round(mean(calories, na.rm = TRUE)),
            ratio = round(protein/calories, digits = 4)) |> 
  rename("Protein content (g)" = protein, 
         "Calories" = calories,
         "Ratio of protein (g) to calories" = ratio,
         "Drink Category" = beverage_category)
kable(starbucks_protein_table, caption = "Starbucks Protein to Calories")
```

![](figures/drinks_analysis/starbucks_drinks_protein_to_calories.png){width="600"}

![](figures/drinks_analysis/starbucks_drinks_protein_to_calories_faceted.png){width="600"}

ANALYZE

In the following table and scatterplot, I compare the same quantities for drinks at Dunkin Donuts. A single scatterplot and faceted scatterplots were included as well.

```{r}
dunkin_protein_table <- dunkin_donuts_drinks_data |> 
  group_by(category) |> 
  summarize(protein = round(mean(protein_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            calories = round(mean(calories, na.rm = TRUE)),
            ratio = round(protein/calories, digits = 4)) |> 
  rename("Protein content (g)" = protein, 
         "Calories" = calories,
         "Ratio of protein (g) to calories" = ratio,
         "Drink Category" = category)
kable(starbucks_protein_table, caption = "Protein to Calories, Dunkin ")
```

![](figures/drinks_analysis/dunkin_drinks_protein_to_calories_faceted.png){width="600"}

ANALYZE

##### Beverages rich in vitamins

Another way I sought to assess how healthy beverages were was by assessing their overall vitamin and mineral contents. Unfortunately, this information was not available for the Dunkin Donuts drinks data. The Starbucks drinks data contains information regarding vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron. For this analysis, I took the sum of the listed percent daily value of each of these nutrients, and divided by four. This calculation results in an estimation of each drink type's percent daily value of all vitamins and minerals that one should consume in a day (i.e. how much of your daily vitamin and mineral content are you getting through each drink). The following table  contains information regarding the average vitamin/mineral percent daily value for each drink type and Starbucks.

```{r}

starbucks_vitamin_table <- starbucks_drinks_data |> 
  group_by(beverage_category) |> 
  summarize(vitamin_a = round(mean(vitamin_a_percent_dv, na.rm = TRUE)),
            vitamin_c = round(mean(vitamin_c_percent_dv, na.rm = TRUE)),
            calcium = round(mean(calcium_percent_dv, na.rm = TRUE)),
            iron = round(mean(iron_percent_dv, na.rm = TRUE)),
            ratio = round((iron + calcium + vitamin_a + vitamin_c)/4, digits = 4)) |> 
  rename("Vitamin A (%DV)" = vitamin_a, 
         "Vitamin C (%DV)" = vitamin_c,
         "Calcium (%DV)" = calcium,
         "Iron (%DV)" = iron,
         "Average %DV of Vitamins and Minerals" = ratio,
         "Drink Category" = beverage_category)
kable(starbucks_vitamin_table, caption = "Average Percent Daily Value of Vitamins and Minerals, Starbucks ")

```

ANALYZE

### Analysis of food data

Similar to the drinks, I then sought to investigate which food items offered are considered the healthiest. The data regarding the beverages offered at Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts was largely similar and contained the same nutritional information. However, the two food datasets, `starbucks_food_data` and `dunkin_donuts_food_data` have far less similarities. The Starbucks food data contains less nutrient information and does not categorize the food items. The Dunkin food data is more detailed and labels the food items at Dunkin Donuts by type. Thus, for this section of the EDA, the analysis was split for the `starbucks_food_data` and `dunkin_donuts_food_data`.

#### Nutritional information of Starbucks food items

First, I identified the healthiest Starbucks food items in five separate categories: highest in protein, highest in fiber, lowest in fat, lowest in carbohydrates, and lowest in calories. The top five food items in each category are listed in the tables below.

```{r}
starbucks_food_protein <- starbucks_food_data |> 
  arrange(desc(protein_g)) %>%
  slice(1:5) |> 
  select(item, protein_g)

kable(starbucks_food_protein, caption = "Highest Protein Foods, Starbucks")

starbucks_food_fiber <- starbucks_food_data |> 
  arrange(desc(fiber_g)) %>%
  slice(1:5) |> 
  select(item, fiber_g)

kable(starbucks_food_fiber, caption = "Highest Fiber Foods, Starbucks")


starbucks_food_fat <- starbucks_food_data |> 
  arrange(fat_g) %>%
  slice(1:5) |> 
  select(item, fat_g)

kable(starbucks_food_fat, caption = "Least Fat Foods, Starbucks")

starbucks_food_carb <- starbucks_food_data |> 
  arrange(carb_g) %>%
  slice(1:5) |> 
  select(item, carb_g)

kable(starbucks_food_carb, caption = "Lowest Carbohydrate Foods, Starbucks")

starbucks_food_calories <- starbucks_food_data |> 
  arrange(calories) %>%
  slice(1:5) |> 
  select(item, calories)

kable(starbucks_food_calories, caption = "Lowest Calorie Foods, Starbucks")

```

The results from the tables above can help consumers in selecting a food item if they are looking for a specific nutrient (or lack of a nutrient) in their diet. 

Nonetheless, I also wanted to assess the healthiness of Starbucks food items while integrating multiple variables. Thus, for each food item, I multipled the grams of fat by the grams of fiber, and then divided by the grams of carbohydrates, grams of fat, and calories. This metric uses all five variables, whereas other metrics can use some combination of these variables.

```{r}
starbucks_food_table <- starbucks_food_data |> 
  group_by(item) |> 
  summarize(protein = round(mean(protein_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            fiber = round(mean(fiber_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            fat = round(mean(fat_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            carb = round(mean(carb_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            fiber_g = round(mean(fiber_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            ratio = round((protein*fiber)/(fat*carb), digits = 4)) |> 
  top_n(10, ratio) |> 
  arrange(desc(ratio)) |> 
  rename("Protein (g)" = protein, 
         "Fiber (g)" = fiber,
         "Carbohydrates (g)" = carb,
         "Fat (g)" = fiber,
         "Healthiness Ratio" = ratio,
         "Food Item" = item)
  

kable(starbucks_food_table, caption = "Health Ratio of Starbucks Food Items")
```

ANALYZE

#### Nutritional Information of Dunkin Donuts Food Items


I first sought to analyze which categories of food items from Dunkin Donuts are the healthiest. The following table records the average protein, fiber, carbohydrate, fat and calorie content in each food category. The following frequency polygons illustrate the protein, fiber, carbohydrate, fat, and calorie information for each category of food items.


```{r}
dunkin_food_table <- dunkin_donuts_food_data |> 
  group_by(category) |> 
  summarize(protein = round(mean(protein_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            fiber = round(mean(fiber_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            carb = round(mean(carb_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            fat = round(mean(fat_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            calories = round(mean(calories, na.rm = TRUE))
            ) |> 
  rename("Average protein content (g)" = protein,
         "Average fiber content (g)" = fiber,
         "Average carbohydrate content (g)" = carb,
         "Average fat content (g)" = fat,
         "Average calories" = calories,
         "Food Category" = category)
kable(dunkin_food_table, caption = "Dunkin Donuts Food Nutrient Information")


```

ANALYZE

It was also sought to determine the healthiness of Dunkin Donuts food categories using multiple variables simultaneously. Thus, the same metric applied to the starbucks food data was used to assess healthiness of each food category. The average protein content was multiplied by the average fiber content, which were then divided by the average carbohydrate and fat content. The results are in the table and frequency polygon below.

```{r}
dunkin_food_table_2 <- dunkin_donuts_food_data |> 
  group_by(category) |> 
  summarize(protein = round(mean(protein_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            fiber = round(mean(fiber_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            fat = round(mean(fat_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            carb = round(mean(carb_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            fiber_g = round(mean(fiber_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            ratio = round((protein*fiber)/(fat*carb), digits = 4)) |> 
  arrange(desc(ratio)) |> 
  rename("Protein (g)" = protein, 
         "Fiber (g)" = fiber,
         "Carbohydrates (g)" = carb,
         "Fat (g)" = fiber,

ANALYZE

Additionally, Dunkin Donuts is arguably best known for their donuts, so I thought it was fitting to analyze the individual donuts themselves. Many consumers come specifically to eat their donuts, so this information can help consumers select the right donut based on their dietary preferences.

```{r}
dunkin_donuts_table <- dunkin_donuts_food_data |> 
  filter(category == "Donuts") |> 
  group_by(item) |> 
  summarize(protein = round(mean(protein_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            fiber = round(mean(fiber_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            fat = round(mean(fat_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            carb = round(mean(carb_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            fiber_g = round(mean(fiber_g, na.rm = TRUE)),
            ratio = round((protein*fiber)/(fat*carb), digits = 4)) |> 
  top_n(10, ratio) |> 
  arrange(desc(ratio)) |> 
  rename("Protein (g)" = protein, 
         "Fiber (g)" = fiber,
         "Carbohydrates (g)" = carb,
         "Fat (g)" = fiber,
         "Healthiness Ratio" = ratio,
         "Food Item" = item)
  
kable(dunkin_donuts_table, caption = "Dunkin Donuts' Donuts Nutritional Information and Healthiness Ratio")
```

Finally, I wanted to use the Dunkin Donuts food data to evaluate how accurate the healthiness metric is assessing the healthiness of a food item. The metric is based on the assumption that the protein and fiber contents (the healthy variables) are inversely proportion to the carbohydrate and fat contents (the unhealthy variables). In order to assess this relationship, the following scatterplots were made comparing the healthy variables to the unhealthy variables.

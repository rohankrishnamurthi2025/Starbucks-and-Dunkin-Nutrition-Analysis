## Introduction

In this report, I am inquiring about the nutritional information of Starbucks' and Dunkin Donuts' food and drink items. The first dataset I am analyzing contains relevant nutritional information of all beverages available at Starbucks. The second dataset concerns all of the food items available at Starbucks. The third dataset concerns the nutritional information of all  products, both food and drink items, available at Dunkin Donuts.

### Motivation for Research

I chose these datasets because I normally enjoy both Starbucks's and Dunkin Donuts' offerings. However, it must be noted that many students and I are currently boycotting Starbucks due to the company's decision to not support for the Palestinian people given the humanitarian crisis they are currently experiencing. While I enjoy their products, I currently will not support the company due to this issue.

Nevertheless, I have had plenty of items from both their drink and food menus and I feel knowledgeable enough to work with data concerning both. Also, I really enjoy making and trying intricate coffee and tea drinks, so I'd be happy to work with data regarding Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. I decided to include the food information as well as a challenge to work with multiple sets of data. Working with data from both Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts allows more depth in the exploration of nutrition information.

### Research Questions

The overarching research question for this EDA is what can one consume at either Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts in order to maintain a healthy, nutritious diet. There are many ways to address this question. Some initial querries are how do the calories, fat, protein and sugar vary by drink type or by food item at either retailer. To involve both food and drink items, I propose investigating which combination of food and drink items is most nutritious, at either Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts. A related question I have is which drink or food items are least nutritious and should be generally avoided. Lastly, I propose questioning how combinations of nutritious food and drinks vary from Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts, and which restaurant has the most nutritious options overall.

## Data Overview and Quality

```{r}
#| label: basic-setup

# load packages and data
library(magick)
library(tidyverse)
library(png)
library(kableExtra)

#EX: my_data <- read_csv("data/starbucks_drinks_data.csv")

starbucks_drinks_data <- starbucks_drinks_data
starbucks_food_data <- starbucks_food_data
#dunkin_donuts_data <- dunkin_donuts_data


```

The three raw datasets were then copied into new datasets, which were then cleaned and prepared for analysis. The first, stored as `starbucks_drinks_data`, contains 18 variables and 242 observations, corresponding to 242 different drinks. Three of the variables contain categorical data, corresponding to drink identifiers, and the remaining 15 variables contain numerical data, corresponding to nutritional information. There are some observations (specifically, caffeine) with missing nutritional values, which contain NA instead of the actual numerical values.

The second dataset, stored as `starbucks_food_data`, contains 6 variables and 113 observations, corresponding to 113 different food items. One variable contains categorical data, corresponding to the food name. The remaining five variables contain numerical data, corresponding to the nutritional information, such as calories, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, and protein content. There are no missing values in this data set.

The third dataset, stored as `dunkin_donuts_data`, contains
